Ever wondered what makes a pizza fly off the shelves (or rather, out of the delivery oven)? In April 2024, I embarked on a delicious quest – analyzing Domino's pizza sales data! But the data, like a half-baked pizza, needed some work before revealing its secrets. I meticulously cleaned and prepped it, ensuring every topping was in its rightful place.

Once the data was ready, I unleashed the power of analysis, uncovering hidden trends and ingredients for success. These weren't just your average cheese and pepperoni insights – they were actionable secrets with the potential to supercharge Domino's sales.

By understanding these key drivers, Domino's can make informed decisions. Optimizing their menu ensures they offer the most crave-worthy pizzas customers desire. Targeted promotions can be crafted to entice specific demographics with the perfect topping combinations. Streamlining delivery routes based on peak order locations can ensure piping hot pizzas reach hungry customers faster. This Domino's sales analysis project demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into a recipe for success, empowering Domino's to make data-driven choices and deliver even more satisfying pizza experiences!
